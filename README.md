## DES Encryption

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) encrypts data in 64-bit blocks, transforming 64 bits of plaintext into 64 bits of ciphertext using the same algorithm and key for both encryption and decryption, with minor differences. Despite its initial popularity, DES has been found vulnerable to powerful attacks due to its 56-bit key length, leading to a decline in its usage.
